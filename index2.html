          <p>Africa is the worldâ€™s second largest and second most populous continent with about one billion people.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately Africa also has the highest health burden in the world.  Diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS are prevalent and the high cost of diagnosis and treatment is an obstacle towards combating these problems.</p>

          <div class="box container well">
          <!-- Insert statistics from WHO. -->
          </div>

          <p>Mobile phones are a major source of communication and means of taking information and technology to rural and remote areas of the continent. With low-cost and readily available mobile phones, underprivileged, low-income earners and rural dwellers can also participate in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) revolution.</p>

          <p>This means that changing how health information and services are delivered using eHealth solutions can have significant impact.</p>

    <h3>Our mission is to improve healthcare access by connecting patients to actionable health information and in doing so enhancing the interaction between patients and their doctor.</h3>    
    <br />
    <h3>We want to do this by providing a platform to improve the patient-doctor relationship by ensuring that primary care to the patient extends past the initial doctor checkup.</h3>
